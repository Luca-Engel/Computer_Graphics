# Title and Summary

Provide us a descriptive title and 1-2 sentences summarizing your project.

# Goals and Deliverables

For this project, our goal is to create a simulation of a fire. This will include an interactive part where the user can move the camera and adapt the fire size.

#### Basic features for passing grade:

- noise function fire
- glowing ash particles flying out of the main fire part
    - have particles die after a certain time (to simulate ashes not glowing after a while)
    - Temperature influencing color of particles


#### Advanced features:
###### We would like to do the following advanced features

- noise function for smoke
- enable moving the camera
    - probably also requires billboarding

- add bloom effect to the particles

- adapt fire size
    - adapt fire temperature
    - adapt speed of particles

###### The following advanced features would be possibilities if we finish the other features early <br> (however, we believe this is out of the scope of this project and we will have plenty of work with the points listed above)

- add background (e.g., fire place with wood logs, etc.)
    - Shadow
- moving the fire with the curser
    - (assuming there is no wind, otherwise this would imply using a lot of physics calculations?)

# Schedule

Specific plan on when and by whom tasks will be completed.

##### Week of 01.05.2023
- instanciate the project
- create fire based on noise function (basic feature)
- start with the glowing ash particles (basic feature)

##### Week of 08.05.2023
- continue with the glowing ash particles (basic feature)
- add noise function for smoke (advanced feature)


##### Week of 15.05.2023
- enable camera movement (advanced feature)
- start with bloom effect for the particles (advanced feature)

##### Week of 22.05.2023
- continue with bloom effect for the particles (advanced feature)
- enable adapting firesize (advanced feature)
- start with presentation video


##### Week of 29.05.2023
- Finalize the presentation video
- Write the report webpage
