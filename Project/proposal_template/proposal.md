# Title and Summary

Provide us a descriptive title and 1-2 sentences summarizing your project.

# Goals and Deliverables

Describe the goals of your project here, following the
[project instructions](https://lgg.epfl.ch/teaching/ICG2019/icg_lectures/2019_project_instructions).

##### Basic features for passing grade:

- particles simulating fire without coloring and highlighting
- have particles die after a certain time (to simulate ashes not glowing after a while)

##### Advanced features:

- physics based simulations: tai chi --> have one simulation with noise functions, one with physical simulation

- add textures to the elements and smoke
- add background (e.g., fire place with wood logs, etc.)
- Temperature influencing color of particles
- adapt fire size
- Smoke
- Wind
- Shadow
- adapt fire temperature
