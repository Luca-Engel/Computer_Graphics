# Title and Summary

Provide us a descriptive title and 1-2 sentences summarizing your project.

# Goals and Deliverables

Describe the goals of your project here, following the
[project instructions](https://lgg.epfl.ch/teaching/ICG2019/icg_lectures/2019_project_instructions).

##### Basic features for passing grade:

- noise function fire
- glowing ash particles flying out of the main fire part
    - have particles die after a certain time (to simulate ashes not glowing after a while)
    - Temperature influencing color of particles


##### Advanced features:
###### We would like to do the following advanced features

- noise function for smoke
- enable moving the camera
    - probably also requires billboarding

- add bloom effect to the particles

- adapt fire size
    - adapt fire temperature
    - adapt speed of particles

###### The following advanced features would be possibilities if we finish the other features early

- add background (e.g., fire place with wood logs, etc.)
    - Shadow
- moving the fire with the curser
    - (assuming there is no wind, otherwise this would imply using a lot of physics calculations?)

# Schedule
